<H1>Hello!</h1>
<p> This is for international shipping for the Sansui</p>
<p>Hi, I have looked into adding international shipping to the listing and learned that I can't since there are already other bids.<br/>
I have heard of websites that act as a third party to ship to international buyers but that would be for you to pursue and research. <br/>
Otherwise, if you are still interested in negotiating a deal. Please email me at the address below</p>
<p>Email me vexer0070@gmail.com </p>

<p> One solution would be to relist it at a price we agree on</p>
